# Sliide
I have used Kotlin and following libraries to do this task:

    Recyclerview Library - To implement the view
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.0.0'
    
    OkHttp3 - To Make Http request
    implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.2.0")
    
    Gson - To parse Json string
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'
    
    Picasso - To load images from url to imageview
    implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'

I haven't foused on UI design as it's not required & took about 2.5 hours to complete it.

Implementing following section is the challenging part.
List consists of
    o 3 rows of content followed
    o Swipable Carousel with 3 content items
    
Also, I have implemented required data classes from the Json string. IF you need further details please do let me know.
